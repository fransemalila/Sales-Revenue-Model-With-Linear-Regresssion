# Sales-Revenue-Model-With-Linear-Regresssion
Linear Regression is a useful tool for predicting a quantitative response.

We have an input vector 𝑋𝑇=(𝑋1,𝑋2,...,𝑋𝑝), and want to predict a real-valued output 𝑌. The linear regression model has the form

1.0.1   𝑓(𝑥)=𝛽0+∑𝑝𝑗=1𝑋𝑗𝛽𝑗. 
The linear model either assumes that the regression function  𝐸(𝑌|𝑋)  is linear, or that the linear model is a reasonable approximation.Here the  𝛽𝑗 's are unknown parameters or coefficients, and the variables  𝑋𝑗  can come from different sources. No matter the source of  𝑋𝑗 , the model is linear in the parameters.
